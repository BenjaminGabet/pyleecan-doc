Development guidelines
########################

We are pleased to welcome you on the PYLEECAN development guidelines page. One interest of an open-source initiative is to
share ideas with a community and develop together the project. We are interested in all sorts of contributions (new features,
documentation, etc.) and we will be glad to include yours in the project.

Before starting to contribute, make sure that you have :doc:`a working pyleecan </get.pyleecan>` and that you know
:doc:`how to use it </tutorials>`.

What to contribute to ?
-----------------------
Pyleecan offers a great diversity of potential contributions:

-  new tutorials or student courses in electric machine design based on Jupyter interactive notebooks
-  new slot or pocket parametric geometries for Pyleecan geometrical modeller
-  new electrical machine topologies (e.g. magnetic gears, brushless doubly fed machines, linear motors)
-  new magnetic models (e.g. coupling with Ansys Maxwell, Magnetic Equivalent Circuits, subdomain models)
-  new multiphysic models (e.g. coupling with Elmer to perform mechanical stress analysis of lamination)
-  new validation tests (e.g. experimental data to check model results)
-  new feature developments (see dedicated `Github issue page <https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/issues>`__)
`The Github issue page <https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/issues>`__ gather what the community is currently thinking and talking about. Feel free to answer a specific issue, open your own issue, or ask how to further help the community on an existing feature request.

Contributing Guidelines
-----------------------
To ensure the quality of the code within the project, this page gathers several guidelines. The idea is to have a clean and
homogeneous code to make sure that anyone can understand it and contribute and that all contributions can be used by anyone.
You don't have to follow all the guidelines, but it will be easier to include your modifications if you do.
We have sorted the guidelines in three groups:

    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        code.contribution
        doc.contribution
        test.contribution
