Development guidelines
########################

We are pleased to welcome you on the PYLEECAN development guidelines page. One interest of an open-source initiative is to
share ideas with a community and develop together the project. We are interested in all sort of contributions (new features,
documentation, etc.) and we will be glad to include yours in the project.

Before starting to contribute, make sure that you have :doc:`a working pyleecan </get.pyleecan>` and that you know
:doc:`how to use it </tutorials>`.

Contributing Guidelines
------------------------
To ensure the quality of the code within the project this page gathers several guidelines. The idea is to have a clean and
homogeneous code to make sure that anyone can understand it and contribute and that all contributions can be used by anyone.
You don't have to follow all the guidelines, but it will be easier to include your modifications if you do.
We have sorted the guidelines in three groups:

    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        code.contribution
        doc.contribution
        test.contribution
