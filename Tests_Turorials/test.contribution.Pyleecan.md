# Tutorial to contribute to the test in Pyleecan

Testing is a very very very important part to develop a software or any IT solution. It may show if the code is well written or not. Nowadays, everyone should
know how powerful testing is and how to write them. A program that haven't be tested, is a program that can bug any time.
