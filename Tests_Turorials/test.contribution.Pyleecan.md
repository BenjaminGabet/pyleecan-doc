# Tutorial to contribute to the test in Pyleecan

Testing is a very very very important part to develop a software or any IT solution. It may show if the code is well written or not. Nowadays, everyone should
know how powerful testing is and how to write them. A program that haven't be tested, is a program that can bug any time.
This tutorial concerns only Pyleecan and its conventions. Jump into it :

__Please notice__, if you don't have time to develop test, please talk about what are the expected results of your model / topology on the Github issues (or in the code itself). We are always looking for validation data, simulation results, experimental measuments, new machines, publications... Anything that can help us making sure that our models are working and will always be.
