Development guidelines
########################

We are pleased to welcome you on the PYLEECAN development guidelines page. The purpose of this page is to provide some
guidelines to ensure the quality of the code within the project. We are interested in all sort of contributions
(new features, documentation, etc.) and we will be glad to include them in the project.

Good practice
--------------

One interest of an open-source initiative is to share ideas with the community and develop together the project.
As the growing PYLEECAN community will be developing the project, it is recommended to all the PYLEECAN community to follow
the contributing guidelines.

Contributing Guidelines
------------------------

We have sorted the contributions in three groups to clarify as much as possible the contributing guidelines.

    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        code.contribution
        doc.contribution
        test.contribution
