On this page, you will find the guidelines to contribute to PYLEECAN documentation. We will present you the
`docstrings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring>`__ format used in PYLEECAN modules and we will explain how
we generate the documentation with Sphinx. The documentation generated will be available on its own Github repository
`pyleecan-doc <https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan-doc>`__ where we will gladly welcome your doc contribution.

PYLEECAN docstring format
--------------------------

For PYLEECANâ€™s modules documentation, the docstring format chosen is **numpydoc** which is the most used format by
the scientific community to document projects. We have also choose this format because it is supported by Sphinx, a tool
used to generate the PYLEECAN website. `The numpydoc docstring guide <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__
explains in details how to write docstrings in numpydoc format.

Here an example of docstrings in a PYLEECAN module

.. code-block:: python

    def build_geometry(self, sym=1, alpha=0, delta=0):

        """Build the geometry of the machine

        Parameters
        ----------
        self : Machine
            Machine object
        sym : int
            Symmetry factor (1= full machine, 2= half of the machine...)
        alpha : float
            Angle for rotation [rad]
        delta : complex
            Complex value for translation
        is_simplified: bool
            True to avoid line superposition

        Returns
        -------
        surf_list : list
            list of surfaces needed to draw the lamination
        """

Sphinx
````````
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ is used to generate the PYLEECAN website by  parsing
the project and generating ".rst" files (**reStructuredText**) according to the documentation (docstrings: numpydoc) in
each module of the project. This ".rst" files will be used after, by Sphinx, to generate the html pages. Note also that to
add pages to PYLEECAN website, we add a .rst file and we regenerate the html pages. You can see the .rst file used to
generate the page by clicking on **show source** on the left side bar of each page.

As example the development main page:

.. image:: _static/development.png

Contribution

There are two different ways to contribute to documentation:

- **By adding docstrings in python modules to document a specific segment of code**. For example the function square below,
  with docstrings in the triple quotes.

.. code-block:: python

    def square(param1):

        """Return the square of param1

        Parameters
        ----------
        param1 : type of the parameter (int)
                description of the parameter
        Returns
        -------
        res type of the value returned (int)
            description of the value returned
        """
        res =  param1 ** 2
        return res

In this case you may have to make a pull request of the module changed to the `pyleecan code <https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan>`__
repository so that we regenerate the documentation on our side. We recommend to see the section
:ref:`code.contribution:Submit your contribution`.

- **By adding a .rst file**, for example if you have developed a new feature and you want to make tutorial of it.

In this case you may want to write the documentation in ".rst" file and :ref:`code.contribution:Submit your contribution` on
`pyleecan-doc <https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan-doc>`__ to share with the community. After the html pages regeneration,
the documentation submitted will be available on the PYLEECAN website.
